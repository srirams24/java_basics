/*
 ***Package**: In Java, a package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Conceptually you can think of packages as being similar to different
 folders on your computer. They help keep classes with the same name separate and organized. The com.sriram part is known as the package name, which typically follows the
 reverse domain name convention to ensure uniqueness across projects.

/*
 **Class**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particuler data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and
 implementations of behavior (methods). The public keyword specifies that this class is accessible everywhere. The class name SimpleCalculator suggests its purposeâ€”to
 perform basic arithmetic operations.
